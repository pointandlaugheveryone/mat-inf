# compulsory Homework 2
  - In this homework your task is to complete the functions `find_minimum()`, `find_maximum()` and `sort_numbers()`
  - As a bonus implementing a harder sorts, such as heap sort or quick sort or even more complex sorts such as hybrid sorts like tim sort will be rewarded with additional positive grade.
  - Additional bonus, your implementations of sorts will be benchmedmarked against each other, the three fastest will get additional positive grade.
  - There are many materials you can use to find different types of sorting algorithms:
    - wiki on sorting algorithms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm
    - geeks for geeks on sorting algorithms: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/sorting-algorithms/
    - check some youtube videos as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMV7ycKZ-mM
  - You can use the `sort_test.py` to test your result
  - **!!YOU ARE ALLOWED TO USE ONLY PYTHON BASIC LIBRARIES!!**
  - **!!ASSIGNMENTS ARE ACCEPTED ONLY IN PYTHON CODE!!**
  - **!!YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE MIN(), MAX() AND PYTHON PREIMPLEMENTED SORT FUNCTIONS!!**
  - **DEADLINE: 09.12**

## example for find_minimum()
```
nums = [10, 245, 13, 4, 15, 6]
solution = find_minimum(nums)
print(solution)
>> 4
```

## example for find_maximum()
```
nums = [10, 245, 13, 4, 15, 6]
solution = find_maximum(nums)
print(solution)
>> 245
```

## example for sort_numbers()
```
nums = [10, 245, 13, 4, 15, 6]
solution = sort_numbers(nums)
print(solution)
>> [4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 245]
```
